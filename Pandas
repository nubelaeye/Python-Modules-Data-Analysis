#                                   1. Introduction' *****
# Pandas is an open-source library in Python that is made mainly for working with relational 
# or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and 
# operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. This library is built on 
# top of the NumPy library of Python. Pandas is fast and it has high performance & 
# productivity for users.

# Why Use Pandas?

# Fast and efficient for manipulating and analyzing data.
# Data from different file objects can be easily loaded.
# Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
# Provides time-series functionality.

# What can you do using Pandas?

# Data set cleaning, merging, and joining.
# Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as 
# non-floating point data.
# Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects.
# Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
# Data Visulaization.

# Pandas Data Structures
# Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are: 

# 1. Series
# 2. DataFrame

# Series..
# Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type 
# (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.
# Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an Excel sheet. Labels need not be unique but must
# be a hashable type. The object supports both integer and label-based indexing and provides 
# a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.

# Creating a Series...
import pandas as pd  
import numpy as np 
  
# Creating empty series  
ser = pd.Series()  
print("Pandas Series: ", ser)  
  
# simple array  
data = np.array(['g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's'])  
    
ser = pd.Series(data)  
print("Pandas Series:\n", ser)

# * DataFrame..
# Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data
# structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). A Data frame is a two-dimensional data 
# structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DataFrame
# consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.

# Creating a DataFrame..

import pandas as pd  
    
# Calling DataFrame constructor  
df = pd.DataFrame()  
print(df) 
  
# list of strings  
lst = ['Geeks', 'For', 'Geeks', 'is', 'portal', 'for', 'Geeks']  
    
# Calling DataFrame constructor on list  
df = pd.DataFrame(lst)  
print(df)

#                                   2. Creating Objects' *****

#       1. Creating Object with Dictonary...

# initialise data of lists.
data = {'Name':['Tom', 'nick', 'krish', 'jack'], 'Age':[20, 21, 19, 18]}
 
# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
# Print the output.
print(df)

#       2. Accessing element of Series..

# There are two ways through which we can access element of series, they are :

# 1. Accessing Element from Series with Position
# 2. Accessing Element Using Label (index)

# Accessing Element from Series with Position :- 
#       In order to access the series element refers to the index number.
# ṣample..
data = np.array(['g','e','e','k','s','f', 'o','r','g','e','e','k','s'])
ser = pd.Series(data)
  
  
#retrieve the first element
print(ser[:5])

# Accessing Element Using Label (index) :
# In order to access an element from series, we have to set values by index label. A Series
# is like a fixed-size dictionary in that you can get and set values by index label.
# sample..
data = np.array(['g','e','e','k','s','f', 'o','r','g','e','e','k','s'])
ser = pd.Series(data,index=[10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22])
  
  
# accessing a element using index element
print(ser[16])

#       3. Indexing and Selecting Data in Series..

data = ser.head(10)
print(data)

# Using loc[] & iloc[] function we can retrieve the data.
print("This is loc function",data.loc[3:5]) 

print("This is iloc function: ",data.iloc[3:7])

#       4. Binary Operations..

# Binary operation methods on series:

# add() - Method is used to add series or list like objects with same length to the caller series
# sub() - Method is used to subtract series or list like objects with same length from the caller series
# mul() - Method is used to multiply series or list like objects with same length with the caller series
# div() - Method is used to divide series or list like objects with same length by the caller series
# sum() - Returns the sum of the values for the requested axis
# prod() - Returns the product of the values for the requested axis
# mean() - Returns the mean of the values for the requested axis
# pow() - Method is used to put each element of passed series as exponential power of caller series and returned the results
# abs() - Method is used to get the absolute numeric value of each element in Series/DataFrame
# cov() - Method is used to find covariance of two series

#       * 5 Pandas Series Methods...

# Series() - A pandas Series can be created with the Series() constructor method. This constructor method accepts a variety of inputs
# combine_first() - Method is used to combine two series into one
# * count() - Returns number of non-NA/null observations in the Series
# size() - Returns the number of elements in the underlying data
# name() - Method allows to give a name to a Series object, i.e. to the column
# * is_unique() - Method returns boolean if values in the object are unique
# * idxmax() - Method to extract the index positions of the highest values in a Series
# * idxmin() - Method to extract the index positions of the lowest values in a Series
# * sort_values() - Method is called on a Series to sort the values in ascending or descending order
# sort_index() - Method is called on a pandas Series to sort it by the index instead of its values
# * [common] head() - Method is used to return a specified number of rows from the beginning of a Series. The method returns a brand new Series
# * [common] tail() - Method is used to return a specified number of rows from the end of a Series. The method returns a brand new Series
# [Read once] - le() - Used to compare every element of Caller series with passed series.It returns True for every element which is Less than or Equal to the element in passed series
# [Read once] - ne() - Used to compare every element of Caller series with passed series. It returns True for every element which is Not Equal to the element in passed series
# [Read once] - ge() - Used to compare every element of Caller series with passed series. It returns True for every element which is Greater than or Equal to the element in passed series
# [Read once] - eq() - Used to compare every element of Caller series with passed series. It returns True for every element which is Equal to the element in passed series
# [Read once] - gt() - Used to compare two series and return Boolean value for every respective element
# [Read once] - lt() - Used to compare two series and return Boolean value for every respective element
# clip() - Used to clip value below and above to passed Least and Max value
# clip_lower() - Used to clip values below a passed least value
# clip_upper() - Used to clip values above a passed maximum value
# [common] astype() - Method is used to change data type of a series
# * tolist() - Method is used to convert a series to list
# * get() - Method is called on a Series to extract values from a Series. This is alternative syntax to the traditional bracket syntax
# unique() - Pandas unique() is used to see the unique values in a particular column
# * nunique() - Pandas nunique() is used to get a count of unique values
# * value_counts() - Method to count the number of the times each unique value occurs in a Series
# factorize() - Method helps to get the numeric representation of an array by identifying distinct values
# map() - Method to tie together the values from one object to another
# * between() - Pandas between() method is used on series to check which values lie between first and second argument
# * apply() - Method is to apply a particular function passed in is applied to all the elements of the series

# For creating a series of only one value in it we can use:-
ser = pd.Series(10, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
 
print(ser)

# Creating a series with a given range:-

ser = pd.Series(range(10))
print(ser)

#                                3. Viewing Data..

# Pandas head() method is used to return top n (5 by default) rows of a data frame or series.
data_top = data.head(4) 
# display 
print("Displaying head of the data with 3 elements on the top",data_top)

# Similarly with the tails function():-
# Pandas tail() method is used to return bottom n (5 by default) rows of a data frame or series.
data_bottom = data.tail() 
  
# display 
print(data_bottom)

# *Pandas DataFrame describe()
# Pandas describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,
# std, etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values.

print(data.describe())

#                              4. Selction & Slicing..

#   1.Dealing with Rows and Columns in Pandas DataFrame

data = {'Name':['Jay','Anuj','Raj','Ewww'],
        'Age':[21,10,8,50],
        'Address':['Delhi', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Kannauj'],
        'Qualification':['Msc', 'MA', 'MCA', 'PhD']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df[['Name','Age']]) # Remember it's double square brackets..

#   2. We can change the column..
address = ['Delhi', 'Bangalore', 'Chennai', 'Patna']
df['Address'] = address
print(df)

# 3. To delete a column in Pandas DataFrame, we can use the drop() method.
df.drop(["Age"], axis = 1 , inplace = True)
print(df)

# In Order to add a Row in Pandas DataFrame, we can concat the old dataframe with new one.
new_row = pd.DataFrame({'Name':'Geeks', 'Team':'Boston', 'Number':3,
                        'Position':'PG', 'Age':33, 'Height':'6-2',
                        'Weight':189, 'College':'MIT', 'Salary':99999},
                                                            index =[0])
# simply concatenate both dataframes
df = pd.concat([new_row, df]).reset_index(drop = True)
print(df.head(5))

#    4.Some * important Factors..
# 1. How to get column names in Pandas dataframe -> data.keys(), data.columns.
# 2. How to rename columns in Pandas DataFrame -> rename(), data.columns = ['new columns'],
#   rankings_pd.set_axis(['A', 'B', 'C'], axis='columns', inplace=True).
# 3. *** How to drop one or multiple columns in Pandas Dataframe ->
data = {
    'A': ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5'],
    'B': ['B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B5', 'B5'],
    'C': ['C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5'],
    'D': ['D1', 'D2', 'D3', 'D4', 'D5'],
    'E': ['E1', 'E2', 'E3', 'E4', 'E5']}
 
# Convert the dictionary into DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
# Remove column name 'A'
# Method 1.
df.drop(df.columns[[0]], axis=1, inplace=True)
# Method 2.
df.pop('C') # Here is the best... 
print(df)

# 4. How to get unique values from a column in Pandas DataFrame
print(df.B.unique()) # and DONE!

# 5. How to lowercase strings in a column in Pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['John', 'bODAY', 'MinA', 'Peter', 'nicky'],
                  'B': ['masters', 'graduate', 'graduate', 
                                   'Masters', 'Graduate'],
                  'C': [27, 23, 21, 23, 24]})
  
df['A'] = df['A'].str.lower() # Same as with the Upper case df['A'] = df['A'].str.upper()
print(df)

# 6. * Capitalize first letter of a column in Pandas dataframe.
df['A'] = df['A'].str.capitalize()# How simp is that!
print(df)

# 7. How to get n-smallest values from a particular column in Pandas DataFrame.
# Just use the function -> df.nsmallest(n, ['column name'])
# and as you might know now for the nlargest valeus.. -> df.nlargest(n, ['column name']).


# *** The major difference between loc[] and iloc[] is :
# loc[] allows you to access data by labels.
# iloc[] allows you to access data by integer location.


#       5. Indexing and Selecting Data with Pandas..

# Pandas support four types of Multi-axes indexing they are:

# Dataframe.[ ] ; This function also known as indexing operator
# Dataframe.loc[ ] : This function is used for labels.
# Dataframe.iloc[ ] : This function is used for positions or integer based
# Dataframe.ix[] : This function is used for both label and integer based

# 1. Selecting a single column
first = data["A"] 

print(first)

#       6. String slicing in Pandas Series..

# making data frame  
data = pd.read_csv("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv")  
    
# removing null values to avoid errors  
data.dropna(inplace = True)  
  
# start stop and step variables 
start, stop, step = 0, -2, 2
  
# converting to string data type 
data["Salary"]= data["Salary"].astype(str) 
  
# slicing till 2nd last element 
data["Salary (int)"]= data["Salary"].str.slice(start, stop, step) 
  
# display 
print(data.head(10)) # All the updation is happening in the Salary(int). After sometime u 
# ṃight understand it well by solving some slicing by hand on your notebook.

#                   5. Operations

# 1. Pandas.apply():-
# Pandas.apply allow the users to pass a function and apply it on every single value of the Pandas series
# It comes as a huge improvement for the pandas library as this function helps to segregate 
# data according to the conditions required due to which it is efficiently used in data 
# science and machine learning.

# 2. Dataframe.aggregate() can used to get the sum, max, min of the data passed in.
# 3. Dataframe.mad() returns the mean absolute deviation of the values for the *[requested axis].
df = pd.DataFrame({"A":[12, 4, 5, 44, 1], 
                   "B":[5, 2, 54, 3, 2],  
                   "C":[20, 16, 7, 3, 8], 
                   "D":[14, 3, 17, 2, 6]}) 

print(df.mad(axis = 0) )

# 4. Pandas dataframe.sem() function return unbiased standard error of the mean over 
# requested axis. The standard error (SE) of a statistic (usually an estimate of a parameter)

# 5. Pandas Series.value_counts().

sr = pd.Series(['New York', 'Chicago', 'Toronto', 'Lisbon', 'Rio', 'Chicago', 'Lisbon']) 
  
# Print the series 
print(sr) 
print(sr.value_counts)

# 6. * Applying Lambda functions to Pandas Dataframe.

# creating and initializing a list
values= [['Rohan',455],['Elvish',250],['Deepak',495],
         ['Soni',400],['Radhika',350],['Vansh',450]] 
 
# creating a pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(values,columns=['Name','Total_Marks'])
 
# Applying lambda function to find 
# percentage of 'Total_Marks' column 
# using df.assign()
df = df.assign(Percentage = lambda x: (x['Total_Marks'] /500 * 100))
 
# 7. Applying to multiple columns..

values_list = [[15, 2.5, 100], [20, 4.5, 50], [25, 5.2, 80],
               [45, 5.8, 48], [40, 6.3, 70], [41, 6.4, 90],
               [51, 2.3, 111]]
 
# creating a pandas dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(values_list, columns=['Field_1', 'Field_2', 'Field_3'])

df = df.assign(Product=lambda x: (x['Field_1'] * x['Field_2'] * x['Field_3']))
 
#                   6. Manipulating Data...

#   1. Adding new column to existing DataFrame in Pandas.

data = {'Name':['Jay','Prachi','Gaurav','Anuj'],
        'Height':[6.5,5.1,5.5,6.7],
        'Qualification':['Msc', 'MA', 'MD','MBA']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

address = ['Banglore','Uttar Pradesh', 'Kerla', 'Andra Pradesh']
# Note that the length of your list should match the length of the index column 
# otherwise it will show an error. 
df['Address'] = address

print(df)

# * We can use the dataframe.insert() to insert the columns in the dataframe at the specific index

df.insert(2, "Age", [21, 23, 24, 21], True)

print(df)

# We can also add the column in the DF by using the df.assign().
df2 = df.assign(address=['Delhi', 'Bangalore', 'Chennai', 'Patna'])
 
# Observe the result
print(df2)

#   2. Delete rows/columns from DataFrame using Pandas.drop().

data = pd.read_csv("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv")  
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)

df.drop(["Team","Name"], axis = 1 , inplace=True)

print(df)

#   3.Pandas DataFrame.truncate.

# Pandas DataFrame.truncate() function is used to truncate a Series or DataFrame before and
# after some index value. This is a useful shorthand for boolean indexing based on index 
# values above or below certain thresholds.

df = pd.DataFrame({'Weight':[45, 88, 56, 15, 71], 
                   'Name':['Sam', 'Andrea', 'Alex', 'Robin', 'Kia'], 
                   'Age':[14, 25, 55, 8, 21]}) 
  
# Create the index 
index_ = pd.date_range('2010-10-09 08:45', periods = 5, freq ='H') 
  
# Set the index 
df.index = index_ 
  
# Print the DataFrame 
print(df) 

result = df.truncate(before = '2010-10-09 09:45:00', after = '2010-10-09 11:45:00') 
  
# Print the result 
print(result) 

#   4.Iterating over rows and columns in Pandas DataFrame.
# 1. Iterating over rows :-

# dictionary of lists 
dict = {'name':["aparna", "pankaj", "sudhir", "Geeku"], 
        'degree': ["MBA", "BCA", "M.Tech", "MBA"], 
        'score':[90, 40, 80, 98]} 
  
# creating a dataframe from a dictionary  
df = pd.DataFrame(dict) 
  
# iterating over rows using iterrows() function  
for i, j in df.iterrows(): 
    print(i, j) 
    print() 

# 2. Iterating over Columns :-
columns = list(df) 
  
for i in columns: 
  
    # printing the third element of the column 
    print (df[i][2]) 
    
# 3. Sorting values in DataFrame.

# Syntax: 

# DataFrame.sort_values(by, axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind=’quicksort’, na_position=’last’)

# data.sort_values("Salary", axis = 0, ascending = True,
#                  inplace = True, na_position ='first')

#                   7. Grouping Data..

# Grouping data in daraframe in pandas in a vast topic. let's cover it with a soft hand of time..
# Staring with first sub topic ->
# 1. Group By
#       Groupby is a pretty simple concept. We can create a grouping of categories and apply a 
# function to the categories. It’s a simple concept but it’s an extremely valuable technique
# that’s widely used in data science.

# There are three types of group by methods to group..
# Splitting : It is a process in which we split data into group by applying some conditions on datasets.
# Applying : It is a process in which we apply a function to each group independently
# Combining : It is a process in which we combine different datasets after applying groupby and results into a data structure

data1 = {'Name':['Jai', 'Anuj', 'Jai', 'Princi', 
                 'Gaurav', 'Anuj', 'Princi', 'Abhi'], 
        'Age':[27, 24, 22, 32, 
               33, 36, 27, 32], 
        'Address':['Nagpur', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Kannuaj',
                   'Jaunpur', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Aligarh'], 
        'Qualification':['Msc', 'MA', 'MCA', 'Phd',
                         'B.Tech', 'B.com', 'Msc', 'MA']} 
    
  
# Convert the dictionary into DataFrame  
df = pd.DataFrame(data1)
  
print(df) 

df.groupby('Name')
print(df.groupby('Name').groups)

gk = df.groupby('Name') 
   
# Let's print the first entries 
# in all the groups formed. 
print(gk.first())
# And the last one with the grouping method we are not going to cover all the grouping methods
# but if you want to check out all the methods of the grouping you can go through the
# GeeksforGeeks documentation of Pandas..
# at the very last let's cover the using spliting for multiple keys in groupby function().
df.groupby(['Name', 'Qualification'])
 
print(df.groupby(['Name', 'Qualification']).groups)

# * we can select a single group using Groupby.get_group.
# selecting a single group
 
grp = df.groupby('Name')
print(grp.get_group('Jai'))

#   2. * Grouping Rows in Pandas.
example = {'Team':['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Arsenal', 
                   'Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 
                   'Manchester United', 'Chelsea', 'Chelsea', 'Chelsea'], 
                     
           'Player':['Ozil', 'Pogba', 'Lucas', 'Aubameyang', 
                       'Hazard', 'Mata', 'Lukaku', 'Morata',  
                                         'Giroud', 'Kante'], 
                                           
           'Goals':[5, 3, 6, 4, 9, 2, 0, 5, 2, 3] } 
  
df = pd.DataFrame(example) 
  
print(df) 

total_goals = df['Goals'].groupby(df['Team']) 
  
# printing the means value 
print(total_goals.mean()) 

# 3. Combining multiple columns in Pandas groupby with dictionary.

dict = { 
    "ID":[1, 2, 3], 
    "Movies":["The Godfather", "Fight Club", "Casablanca"], 
    "Week_1_Viewers":[30, 30, 40], 
    "Week_2_Viewers":[60, 40, 80], 
    "Week_3_Viewers":[40, 20, 20] }; 
  
# Convert dictionary to dataframe 
df = pd.DataFrame(dict); 
print(df) 

groupby_dict = {"Week_1_Viewers":"Total_Viewers", 
           "Week_2_Viewers":"Total_Viewers", 
           "Week_3_Viewers":"Total_Viewers", 
           "Movies":"Movies" } 
  
df = df.set_index('ID') 
df = df.groupby(groupby_dict, axis = 1).sum() 
print(df) 

#                       8. Pandas Merging, Joining, and Concatenating..

# 1. We can join, merge, and concat dataframe using different methods. In Dataframe 
# df.merge(),df.join(), and df.concat() methods help in joining, merging and
# concating different dataframe.

# It's too easy peasy but important too..
# Define a dictionary containing employee data 
data1 = {'Name':['Jai', 'Princi', 'Gaurav', 'Anuj'], 
        'Age':[27, 24, 22, 32], 
        'Address':['Nagpur', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Kannuaj'], 
        'Qualification':['Msc', 'MA', 'MCA', 'Phd']} 
   
# Define a dictionary containing employee data 
data2 = {'Name':['Abhi', 'Ayushi', 'Dhiraj', 'Hitesh'], 
        'Age':[17, 14, 12, 52], 
        'Address':['Nagpur', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Kannuaj'], 
        'Qualification':['Btech', 'B.A', 'Bcom', 'B.hons']} 
 
# Convert the dictionary into DataFrame  
df = pd.DataFrame(data1,index=[0, 1, 2, 3])
 
# Convert the dictionary into DataFrame

print(res) 
# The df.append() might be removed because while i was running I got a message from terminal:
# FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in 
# a future version. Use pandas.concat instead.

# 2. Concatenating column with separator.
data = pd.read_csv("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv")
print(data)
# making copy of team column
new = data["Team"].copy()
 
# concatenating team with name column
# overwriting name column

# 3. * Handiling null values...
new = data["Team"].copy()
 
# string to replace null values with
na_string ="No College"
 
# concatenating team with name column
# overwriting name column
data["College"]= data["College"].str.cat(new, sep =", ", na_rep = na_string)
print(data)

# 4. Pandas Index.append() -> A new type of data structure. But here also we will use append.

df1 = pd.Index([17, 69, 33, 5, 0, 74, 0])
 
# Creating the second Index
df2 = pd.Index([11, 16, 54, 58])
 
# Print the first and second Index
print(df1, "\n", df2)

# [1/2 *] 6. Add a row at top in pandas DataFrame. 
df = pd.read_csv("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv") 
 
print(df.head(5))

new_row = pd.DataFrame({'Name':'Geeks', 'Team':'Boston', 'Number':3,
                        'Position':'PG', 'Age':33, 'Height':'6-2',
                        'Weight':189, 'College':'MIT', 'Salary':99999},
                                                            index =[0])
# simply concatenate both dataframes
df = pd.concat([new_row, df]).reset_index(drop = True)
print(df.head(5))

# 7. Pandas str.join() to join string/list elements with passed delimiter.

data = pd.read_csv("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nba.csv") 
  
# dropping null value columns to avoid errors 
data.dropna(inplace = True) 
    
# joining string and overwriting  
data["Name"]= data["Name"].str.join("-") 

# splitting string and overwriting  
data["Team"]= data["Team"].str.split("t") 
# display 
print(data)

# 8. We can compare two dataframe with the help of df.compare(df1,df2)

# 9. How to compare the elements of the two Pandas Series?
# Method 1: Using Relational operator -> ==,!=,<,>.
# Method 2: Using Series.equal() -> Series is just a name here!

#                     9. Working with date and time using Pandas.

# 1. date and time
data = pd.date_range('1/1/2011', periods = 10, freq='H')
print(data)

# 2. Moving further in the topic: Creating range of dates and show basic features.

x = pd.datetime.now()
print(x.month, x.year)

# A new FutureWarning: The pandas.datetime class is deprecated and will be removed from
# pandas in a future version. Import from datetime module instead.

# 3. *** Current timestamp
t = pd.Timestamp.now()
print(t)

print(t.year)
print(t.month)
print(t.day)
print(t.hour)
print(t.minute)
print(t.second)

# 4. Pandas Timestamp.timestamp() function return the time expressed as the number of seconds
# that have passed since January 1, 1970. That zero moment is known as the epoch.

ts = pd.Timestamp(year = 2023,  month = 11, day = 11,  
                  hour = 8, second = 49, tz = 'US/Central')  
  
print(ts.timestamp())
# 5. U can also use timestamp.now() -> for printing the current time..

# 6. Pandas Timestamp.isoformat()
# Pandas Timestamp.isoformat() function is used to convert the given Timestamp object into the ISO format.
print(ts.isoformat()) 

# 7. Using ts.date() u can get the current date
print(ts.date())

# 8. Pandas Timestamp.replace() function is used to replace the member values of the given Timestamp.
print(ts.replace(year = 2011))
# sample 2.
print(ts.replace(year = 2019, month = 12, hour = 1))

# * 9. pandas.date_range() method.
# pandas.date_range() is one of the general functions in Pandas which is used to
# return a fixed frequency DatetimeIndexes.

# Specify start and periods, the number of periods (days). 
dRan1 = pd.date_range(start ='1-1-2018', periods = 13) 
  
# Specify end and periods, the number of periods (days). 
dRan2 = pd.date_range(end ='1-1-2018', periods = 13) 

# Specify start, end, and periods; the frequency  
# is generated automatically (linearly spaced). 
dRan3 = pd.date_range(start ='01-03-1945',  
            end ='1-1-2018', periods = 20) 
  
print(dRan1, "\n\n", dRan2, '\n\n', dRan3)
# If the range is not big enough so it uses the time interval give in it. Else it uses random
# dates to full fill the requirement of the range..

#                         9. Pandas Working With Text Data.

# 1. Series and Indexes are equipped with a set of string processing methods that make it easy
# to operate on each element of the array. Perhaps most importantly, these methods exclude
# missing/NA values automatically.

data = {'Name':['Jai', 'Princi', 'Gaurav', 'Anuj'], 
        'Age':[27, 24, 25, 32], 
        'Address':['Delhi', 'Kanpur', 'Allahabad', 'Kannauj'], 
        'Qualification':['Msc', 'MA', 'MCA', 'Phd']} 
   
# Convert the dictionary into DataFrame  
df = pd.DataFrame(data) 
   
# converting and overwriting values in column 
print(df)

df["Name"]= df["Name"].str.lower()

df["Qualification"]= df["Qualification"].str.upper()

df["Age"]= df["Age"].replace(25, "Twenty five") 

df["Name"]= df["Name"].str.cat(new, sep =", ") 

print(df)

# 2. At the very end let's see all the str functions in the Pandas str.
# Pandas str methods:

# FUNCTION	DESCRIPTION
# str.lower()	Method to convert a string’s characters to lowercase
# str.upper()	Method to convert a string’s characters to uppercase
# str.find()	Method is used to search a substring in each string present in a series
# str.rfind()	Method is used to search a substring in each string present in a series from the Right side
# str.findall()	Method is also used to find substrings or separators in each string in a series
# str.isalpha()	Method is used to check if all characters in each string in series are alphabetic(a-z/A-Z)
# str.isdecimal()	Method is used to check whether all characters in a string are decimal
# str.title()	Method to capitalize the first letter of every word in a string
# str.len()	Method returns a count of the number of characters in a string
# str.replace()	Method replaces a substring within a string with another value that the user provides
# str.contains()	Method tests if pattern or regex is contained within a string of a Series or Index
# str.extract()	Extract groups from the first match of regular expression pattern.
# str.startswith()	Method tests if the start of each string element matches a pattern
# str.endswith()	Method tests if the end of each string element matches a pattern
# str.isdigit()	Method is used to check if all characters in each string in series are digits
# str.lstrip()	Method removes whitespace from the left side (beginning) of a string
# str.rstrip()	Method removes whitespace from the right side (end) of a string
# str.strip()	Method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from string
# str.split()	Method splits a string value, based on an occurrence of a user-specified value
# str.join()	Method is used to join all elements in list present in a series with passed delimiter
# str.cat()	Method is used to concatenate strings to the passed caller series of string.
# str.repeat()	Method is used to repeat string values in the same position of passed series itself
# str.get()	Method is used to get element at the passed position
# str.partition()	Method splits the string only at the first occurrence unlike str.split()
# str.rpartition()	Method splits string only once and that too reversely. It works in a similar way like str.partition() and str.split()
# str.pad()	Method to add padding (whitespaces or other characters) to every string element in a series
# str.swapcase()	Method to swap case of each string in a series

# 3. Although, U may have gone through the Numpy documentation too. Now u might know the best function in the 
# string of numpy is the title(). And luckly we also have the title() in the pandas too.

df["Name"] = df["Name"].str.upper().str.title()
print(df)

# 4. * Pandas Series.str.replace() to replace text in a series -> [U might be familiar wit this one!].

data = {'text': ['Blue', ' Green ', 'Red ']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
df['text'] = df['text'].str.replace(' ', '_')
print(df)

data['text'].where('text').dropna()
print(df)

# Owww ! You are really amazing that u reach here at the finishing line of the Pandas library.
# Thanks for visiting.
# Bye!
